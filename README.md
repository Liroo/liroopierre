### Features

> I always try to maintain packages to the last version

- [Babel 7](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/) for JavaScript
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) preprocessor for CSS
- Really basic simple sass mixins including:
   + [font-face](https://gist.github.com/jonathantneal/d0460e5c2d5d7f9bc5e6) Import font easily
   + [sass-mq](https://github.com/sass-mq/sass-mq) A famous mq utily developed by The Guardian and the one I used every time
- [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/) for managing, compiling and optimizing theme's asset files
- [BrowsersSync](https://github.com/Va1/browser-sync-webpack-plugin) for live reload the website during the dev
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) Already integrated as global
- Readable and centralized Theme Configs

###### And nothing more!

> Firstly because I do not want to focus this theme on especially one usage. That's why there is no pre-installed framework or useless mixins.
> And also because I want to maintain this theme updated so no surcharge :)
